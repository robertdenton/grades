<h1>CU Independent Grades Database</h1>

See it live <a href="http://www.cuindependent.com/grades">HERE</a>.

This is a searchable, sortable representation of every class at CU during the spring 2013 and fall 2013 semesters and each's grade distribution. In other words, what percent of the class got an A, B, C or D/F.

All of the data, and more, is publically accessible through the <a href="www.colorado.edu/pba/â€Ž">CU Office of Planning and Budget Analysis</a> <a href="www.colorado.edu/pba/course/gradesintro.htm">here</a>.

With much help from <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a>.
