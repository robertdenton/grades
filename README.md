<h1>CU Independent Grades Database</h1>

See it live <a href="http://www.cuindependent.com/grades">HERE</a>.

This is a searchable, sortable representation of every class at CU during the spring 2013 and fall 2013 semesters and each's grade distribution. In other words, what percent of the class got an A, B, C or D/F.

All of the data, and more, is publically accessible through the <a href="www.colorado.edu/pba/â€Ž">CU Office of Planning and Budget Analysis</a> <a href="www.colorado.edu/pba/course/gradesintro.htm">here</a>.

With much help from <a href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables</a>.

<b>NOTE: The MySQL connection info has been changed in the index.php, you'll need to adjust that to your needs with your data.</b>

<i>If you'd like to produce something similar at your student media organization, let me know and I'd be happy to help. If there's enough interest, I may write up a brief How-To.</i>
